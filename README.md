## Introduction

Merging two sorted lists is a common task in programming. It often appears in algorithms and data processing tasks. This program aims to simplify that process. It provides a clear method to combine two lists while keeping the elements in order.

## Features

- Merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
- Handles edge cases, such as empty lists.
- Written in Java for easy integration into other projects.
- Clear and concise code with comments for better understanding.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- An IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Kadirbaba4916/Merge-Two-Sorted-list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Merge-Two-Sorted-list
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

## How to Use

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Create two sorted lists. You can use arrays or any other data structure.
2. Call the `merge` method provided in the `MergeSortedLists` class.
3. The method will return a new sorted list containing all elements from both lists.

### Sample Code

Hereâ€™s a quick look at how to use the merge function:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] list1 = {1, 3, 5, 7};
        int[] list2 = {2, 4, 6, 8};

        MergeSortedLists merger = new MergeSortedLists();
        int[] mergedList = merger.merge(list1, list2);

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(mergedList));
    }
}
```

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following main components:

- **Main.java**: Contains the entry point of the program.
- **MergeSortedLists.java**: Implements the logic for merging two sorted lists.
- **README.md**: This file, providing documentation for the project.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the program works:

Given two sorted lists:

- List 1: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`
- List 2: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

The merged output will be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
